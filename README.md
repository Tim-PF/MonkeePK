MonkeePK is a custom programming language built from scratch. In this project, we will write our own lexer, parser, Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), internal object system, and evaluator.

Project Overview
This project is divided into several phases, where we will develop each component of our language. The language will be implemented in Go and consists of the following steps:

1. Lexer
The lexer is the first module of our language, responsible for tokenizing the input code. It breaks the source code into smaller elements called tokens, which will then be processed by the parser.

2. Parser
The parser processes the tokens generated by the lexer and converts them into a structure that follows the logical grammar of the language. This results in the creation of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

3. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
The AST is a hierarchical representation of the source code

4. Internal Object System
The internal object system is responsible for managing and representing data types, variables, and objects used within the MonkeePK programming language. It handles memory management and defines the behavior of built-in and user-defined types.

5. Evaluator
The evaluator takes the AST generated by the parser and executes it. It evaluates expressions, statements, and performs the necessary computations based on the rules defined by the language.
